1.Write a program that extracts part of the given string from the specified position. For example,
 if the sting is "Working with strings is fun",then if from position 4, 4 characters 
 are to be extracted then the program should return string as "king". If the number
 of characters to be extracted is 0 then the program should extract entire string
 from the specified position.

2.Write a program that converts a string like "124" to an integer 124.

3.Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str[ ]. Receive two 
 strings str1 and str2 and check if str1 is embedded in any of the strings in str[ ].
 If str1 is found, then replace it with str2.char *str[ ] = { "We will teach you how
 to...", "Move a mountain","Level a building", "Erase the past", "Make a million",
 "...all through C!" } ; For example if str1 contains "mountain" and str2 contains 
"car",then the second string in str should get changed to "Move a car".

4.Write a program to reverse the strings stored in the following array of pointers
 to strings: char *s[ ] ={ "To err is human...", "But to really mess things up...",
 "One needs to know C!!" } ;
